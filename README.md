Just a factory-management game inspired by Factorio and Foundry i do by myself, still no name given for now

Some stuff to add later:

- Saves
- Game settings
- In-game settings:
  - Resources wealthness
  - Economy stuff
  - Factions that buy stuff
    -> they can buy stuff for more if they like you, or less if they hate you
  - Biomes
    Biomes stuff that can be toggled too :
    - Biomes banned/favorites
    - World temperature (biomes with that temp are more likely to spawn)
    - Biome interferences with stuff like craft time or crops maybe, tree..
  - Gamemode
- Bot logic
  - Path finding or following path
  - Auto detect what item to take out from buildings (either what is crafted or what is needed to craft)
- Missions from NPCs instead of trading, or both but mainly missions, then trades are worth less
